## SQL E-commerce Analysis with Python Visualizations

This project analyzes a simplified e-commerce database using **SQL** to extract key business insights, followed by **Python-based visualizations** to communicate trends clearly and effectively.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how raw transactional data can be transformed into **decision-ready insights** using a practical analytics workflow.

---

## Database Schema

The analysis is based on three core tables:

* **customers** – customer details and signup information
* **orders** – order transactions including quantity, unit price, date, and region
* **products** – product names and categories

---

## Analysis Performed (SQL)

All core metrics were calculated using SQL queries.

**Business questions answered:**

* What is the **total revenue** generated by the business?
* How does **revenue change month over month**?
* Who are the **top 10 customers by revenue**?
* Which are the **top 10 products by revenue**?
* What is the **average order value (AOV)**?

---

## Visualizations (Python)

To make the insights easier to interpret, selected results were visualized using **Python** in Google Colab.

**Visuals created:**

* Monthly revenue trend
* Top 10 customers by revenue
* Top 10 products by revenue

The data for these visualizations was sourced directly from SQL query outputs and processed using **pandas**, with charts created using **matplotlib**.

The final plots were exported as `.png` files and uploaded to this repository.

---

## Key Insights

* Revenue shows a consistent **month-over-month trend**, making it easier to identify growth patterns.
* A small subset of customers contributes a **disproportionately large share of total revenue**.
* Certain products consistently outperform others, indicating clear **revenue drivers**.
* Average order value provides a baseline for potential **upselling and bundling strategies**.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL (MySQL)** – data querying and aggregation
* **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** – data handling and visualization
* **Google Colab** – notebook environment for analysis
* **GitHub** – version control and project sharing

---

## Repository Structure

* `schema.sql` – table creation and sample data insertion
* `queries.sql` – SQL queries used for analysis

---

### Notes

This project focuses on **clarity of analysis and communication**, mirroring a real-world workflow where SQL is used for computation and Python is used for presentation.
