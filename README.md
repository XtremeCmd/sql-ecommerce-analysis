# SQL E-commerce Analysis

This project analyzes a simplified e-commerce database using SQL to extract insights on revenue performance, customer spending, and product-level sales.

## Database Schema
The analysis is based on three core tables:
- `customers` – customer details and signup information  
- `orders` – order transactions including quantity, price, date, and region  
- `products` – product names and categories  

## Business Questions Answered
- What is the total revenue generated by the business?
- How does revenue trend month over month?
- Who are the top customers by revenue contribution?
- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- What is the average order value (AOV)?

## Key Insights
- Revenue shows a consistent upward trend across the analyzed months.
- A small group of customers contributes a significant share of total revenue.
- Electronics-related products dominate top revenue-generating items.
- Average order value highlights opportunities for upselling and bundling.

## Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)

## Files
- `schema.sql` – table creation and data insertion  
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries used for analysis
